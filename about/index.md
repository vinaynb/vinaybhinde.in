I got involved in web development after landing my first (also my current) job after college. I was drawn to web technologies because of the vibrant community even back in 2010.

> The amount of readily coded stuff the community pushes out is very attractive for a college student building his first website!

Over the years, I have worked across the stack in multiple capacities and technologies, from large-scale web and mobile apps to cloud infrastructure. I have led teams focused on frontend engineering with a strong emphasis on clean code and best practices.

## Experience

Being in a small team at **Avesta** has exposed me to many different parts of building software from the technical perspective.

Over the years I have worked across EdTech, Industrial IoT, and PropTech. I have led modernization initiatives for customers, leading teams of 40+ engineers and contributing across the stack, from architecture and system design to setting best practices for delivery and quality.

Early in my career, I developed web apps with JavaScript frameworks like Ext.JS, and then moved to AngularJS.

With AngularJS I was responsible for setting up the core services layer and frontend architecture used across web projects at the company.

Later I focused on performance across web and mobile apps, improving code quality and speed. (I wrote a small [guide](https://github.com/team-avesta/wiki/blob/master/engineering/frontend/optimizing-angularjs-apps.md) for AngularJS 1.x apps at that time.)

In recent years, I have led teams building web and mobile apps with React and React Native. I have also trained teams on getting started with React and setting up best practices. Code reviews are now part of my daily work.

Alongside frontend leadership, I have deployed apps on the cloud using containers, setting up infrastructure and deploying frontend and backend services required to operate at scale.

## Today

<!-- He is currently looking for a new opportunity, [reach out here](mailto:jmenichelli@gmail.com). -->

I currently work as a Product Engineer at [Avesta HQ](https://avestahq.com) and [Avesta Labs](https://avestalabs.ai).

My role currently involves more of architecting/setting up things and mentoring junior devs, but I am still involved in the day-to-day coding in various capacities.

I started in frontend engineering, but over time I have moved into broader responsibilities across teams, architectures, and business outcomes. I believe AI is a watershed moment for software, changing what we build and how we build it. It is fascinating to see the leverage AI provides in building products, and I am now focused on learning more about what to build rather than only how to build it.

I also have [AWS Developer Associate certification](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=2&t=c&d=2020-01-16&ci=AWS01242182), which reflects my production-grade experience with AWS services.

I am currently looking out for speaking opportunities.
