		"abstract": "In this session we are going to explore writing tests for your UI keeping in mind the end users using testing-library. In many of the current libraries/frameworks we end up most of the times, testing the implementation details of the code, and not the final output that gets rendered in UI. I want to show how to not do that and have tests which give you high confidence when releasing"
